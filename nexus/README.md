# Nexus: Digital Twin Simulation for Chemical Process Optimization

This project is a sophisticated Python-based simulation framework that creates a digital twin of an integrated chemical process network. It incorporates real-time optimization, predictive analytics, and comprehensive sustainability assessment.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains scripts for data generation and storage for raw/processed data.
- `nexus_core/`: The core simulation engine, including process models and solvers.
- `digital_twin/`: The digital twin framework for real-time integration and model adaptation.
- `ml_suite/`: The machine learning suite for predictive modeling and anomaly detection.
- `optimization/`: The optimization framework for multi-objective optimization problems.
- `sustainability/`: The sustainability module for life cycle assessment and carbon accounting.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for the entire framework.

## Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Generate Synthetic Data:**
    Navigate to the `data` directory and run the data generation script:

    ```bash
    cd data
    python generate_synthetic_data.py
    ```
